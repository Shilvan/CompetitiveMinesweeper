/**
 * The interface each AI has to implement in order to allow it to take part in a
 * competition. Implementors of this interface can be launched by a configurator
 * in their dedicated threads. For details see
 * {@link MineSweeper#launchCompetitor(Class, MineMap, boolean)} for details.
 * Notice that this interface extends the {@link Runnable} interface. Which
 * means an extra run method also has to be implemented in it. The
 * {@link Runnable#run()} method should provide the AI's main functionality
 * (i.e., exploration). To understand how simple exploration of the map would
 * work, have a look at the {@link SimpleLineByLineSolver}. To simpify the
 * implementation of this interface it is a good idea to start it by extending
 * the class {@link AbstractSolver}.
